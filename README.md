## About this Project

This app was created as part of the **100 Days of SwiftUI** challenge by [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), specifically for **Day 77**. The goal of this challenge was to build a photo management app that allows users to import, name, and organize their photos.
